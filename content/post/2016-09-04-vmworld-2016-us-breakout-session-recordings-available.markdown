**Edit:** At the time of publishing, the main page at www.vmworld.com is not rendering correctly (it is just showing a blank white page where the videos should be), though it was a few days ago. The URL that should be displaying on the vmworld URL below is [http://www.webcastregister2016.com/vmware/form.php](http://www.webcastregister2016.com/vmware/form.php), and you can go directly to this URL to access the videos if the URL below is not working when you try.

Just a quick post to note that the recordings for all of the breakout sessions from VMworld 2016 US are now available online at [this URL](https://www.vmworld.com/en/sessions/2016.html).

Historically the recordings were only available to those who attended the conference (or I believe there was a fee that could be paid to gain access to the videos), but it appears that all sessions are available for free public consumption for VMworld 2016.

I think free access to the recorded sessions is fantastic and well done to the teams who got these up so quickly after the event. Streaming will be a bit busier than usual in my household over the next few days!
