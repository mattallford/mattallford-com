This approached very quickly, and next week one of the hottest VMware events in ANZ will be held in Sydney and Melbourne - the VMUG UserCon events!

VMUG UserCons are a free one day event held once a year featuring a small vendor expo area, lots of educational sessions throughout the day, excellent opening and closing keynotes and of course the opportunity to mingle with industry peers, catch up with old friends and make a few new friends. Sydney Usercon will be on March 19th, and Melbourne UserCon will follow on March 21st.

This year we have [Chris Wolf](https://twitter.com/cswolf) taking on the opening keynote, titled "**Inside VMware R&D and the Office of the CTO Innovation**". I think it is easy for the industry in general to park VMware in the corner as the "virtualisation company", but they are so much more than this and I'm really looking forward to this keynote as I think it will provide a really interesting look in to some great areas within the beast that is VMware.

The closing keynote is being presented by [Mike Foley](https://twitter.com/mikefoley), titled "**Security as I see it - IT's next big challenge**". I've not met Mike in person, but from what I've seen via his sessions and written material, Mike takes a "no bullsh*t" approach and has a vast technical knowledge in the security industry. With a title focusing on the future I'm intrigued as to the topics that Mike will cover in this session.

In between these keynotes is a packed agenda with 3, sometimes 4 break out sessions on at once. The content as usual looks fantastic and I'm going to have a hard time deciding where my time is spent. Go ahead and check out the event details in the links below for the agenda for the day, including information on all of the sessions.

This year I am lucky enough to be presenting a session at both events with my good friend [Tim Carman](https://twitter.com/tpcarman). We're providing an update on a PowerShell project that both of us have been working on, Tim for over a year and myself for 9+ months, named [AsBuiltReport](https://twitter.com/AsBuiltReport). The aim of the tool is to automate the creation of as built documentation for many solutions, of course including VMware products. The session should be around 50% live demos and we truly believe this tool makes life much easier for consultants, solution providers, solution implementers and operational staff. If you are at either event we'd love to see you in the session. Hopefully you can take something away from it, we're also keen to get some contributors on board as well to help enhance the current reports and help write new reports. Thanks Tim for having me on board and thanks to the VMUG crew for accepting our session and supporting some of our travel!

If you are in Melbourne or Sydney and currently work with or are looking to work with VMware technologies, I'd strongly recommend you head down for the day. I've been to the Melbourne UserCon for the last two years and it is one of the few technical events that are basically pencilled in to my calendar every year.
