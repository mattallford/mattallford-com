# New Pluralsight Course: Formatting Data in PowerShell
I'm a bit late to the party with this post, as this course went live around the 27th of October, 2020, but I'm happy to say I've had my second course at Pluralsight recently go live!

This course is another PowerShell based course in the PowerShell 7 fundamentals track at Pluralsight, titled [Formatting Data in PowerShell](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/formatting-data-powershell/table-of-contents). This course is aimed to help you understand the PowerShell formatting system and why results are formatted the way they are by default, and then how to override that formatting to get the data in the format you need it in.

I hope you enjoy the course. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments!
