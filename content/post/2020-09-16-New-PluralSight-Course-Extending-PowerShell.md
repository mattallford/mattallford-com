This is a short post and I'll cut straight to it. I'm really happy to announce that I've published my first course with Pluralsight, [Extending PowerShell](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/kBqq3). The course is aimed at helping you learn and understand PowerShell Modules and is part of a larger learning path for PowerShell 7 that is being produced currently on PowerShell.

I have worked hard to make this demo heavy in a way that you can follow along with each task, and I hope you do, as the hands-on is where the knowledge gets solidified.

I'm really happy to have been able to produce content for a company as prestigious as Pluralsight, but I also acknowledge that I did not get here alone, and I have several people to thank for providing me with an opportunity to push in to content creation and who have provided valuable feedback along the way. You will know who you are.

I'm also greatful to have been able to create a course on PowerShell, which has been a pivitol tool in my career and I know the same can be said for many others. It is an honour to be involved in helping people learn PowerShell.

If you don't have access to Pluralsight, there is an option to sign up for a no obligation [10-day personal trial](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/2411491/431405/7490).

I hope you enjoy the course and I look forward to any feedback you have, as well as sharing your success with PowerShell!
