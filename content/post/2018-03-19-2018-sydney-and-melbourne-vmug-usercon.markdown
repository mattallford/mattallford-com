Well, it's that time of the year again. The VMware User Group (VMUG) UserCon's are on again this week in Sydney (Tuesday 20th March) and Melbourne (Thursday 22nd March), Australia. VMUG UserCon is a **free** day long event filled with a few keynotes, breakout sessions, networking and checking out the exhibit hall.

I've personally only attended one UserCon, which I wrote about [here](https://virtualtassie.com/2017/melbourne-vmug-usercon-2017/), but I was really impressed at the organisation and presence from VMware, sponsors and community members. It really is one of the stand out events of the year for me, and I'm glad to be attending the Melbourne UserCon again this year, thanks to my employer.

All I can say is that if you are in town and are in the automation / data centre / cloud space, come along and see some excellent sessions from industry experts and meet some of the best in the business. You never know who you'll end up having lunch next to and get chatting with.

For more information and to register, check out the [Melbourne](https://www.vmug.com/Attend/VMUG-UserCon/2018/Melbourne-VMUG-UserCon-2018) and [Sydney](https://www.vmug.com/Attend/VMUG-UserCon/2018/Sydney-VMUG-UserCon-2018) pages.

Hope to see you there!
