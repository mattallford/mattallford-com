This is a really quick post to let followers / subscribers of the blog know that I have recently launched a newsletter. It's been 2.5 years since I've posted here (oops!) and in that time, I've been working as an Azure DevOps Engineer.

In my role I gain invaluable insights and knowledge that I'm eager to share with you. Through the newsletter, we'll explore the latest trends, keep you updated on community happenings, and offer career tips to help you thrive in the cloud industry.

If that sounds like something you'd love to receive, I invite you to sign up by visiting the URL below:
