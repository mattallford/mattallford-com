If you'd like to see what I've been working on, you're in the right place! This page contains a summary of content I've created on different platforms, community contributions and projects I've been involved with.

# Courses
I've created video based training courses for several platforms, which are listed below.

### Pluralsight
I'm a Pluralsight author, and the easiest place to find my Pluralsight courses are at my author page, which is below. While you're there, make sure to follow me to get a notification of any courses I release in the future! Be sure to check out the library if you're not already a member, I've been a long-term learner on the platform.

### CloudSkills / INE
CloudSkills is an online learning community with a focus on creating read-world cloud training, with a focus on cloud & devops. The quality of the content available at CloudSkills is phenominal, but they also have one of the best community cultures I've had the privilege of being a part of. CloudSkills were aquired by INE in January 2022.

The course I have created at CloudSkills/INE are:

[Azure Functions for DevOps Engineers](https://cloudskills.io/courses/azure-functions)
[Azure Template Specs: Infrastructure as Code](https://ine.com/learning/courses/azure-template-specs-infrastructure-as-code)

# YouTube

I know some people prefer consuming content by reading, and others much prefer by watching and listening. Because of this, I'm trying to create a bunch of my content in both formats. You can find my YouTube channel here, if you like what you see, please go ahead and subscribe, it helps a lot!

# Guest Blog Contributions

As well as publishing posts here on my own blog, I occasionally post content on other platforms. As well as (hopefully) reading my posts, please do check out the other content on these platforms as they are filled with fantastic information.

# GitHub

I'm still working on getting in to a good habit with storing my code in source control, but when I do, you can find it over [on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/mattallford).

# Public Speaking
If any of the sessions I present are recorded and are publically available, I'll link them here!
