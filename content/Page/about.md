Hi there, and welcome! My name is Matt Allford. 

I have a passion for a lot of technology, focusing on Infrastructure, virtualisation, powershell and am early in my learning path of automation processes and techniques to enhance consistency and reliability. In my previous role I was working at a University as a Senior Systems Administrator where I was the lead architech and administrator for a number of solutions including Microsoft Exchange, ADFS, Microsoft failover clustering and the core Microsoft Windows Services, among other things.

I'm very approachable and love to build relationships within the community. Please feel free to reach out and say hi!
